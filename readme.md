# 🍜 API Testing Lab: Auntie Som’s Noodle Stall

> **Objective:** Prove that Nephew Lek’s "it works on my machine" attitude is a recipe for disaster.

---

## 📖 The Backstory

Auntie Som runs a **legendary noodle stall**. Her Tom Yum is world-class, her customers are loyal, and her business is booming.  

Recently, her nephew **Lek** (who just finished a 2-week coding bootcamp) decided to "digitize" the business. He built a backend API to handle online orders. Auntie Som is thrilled, but the code… well, Lek says:  

> *"It’s fine lah Auntie! I tested it once with my own phone. No need for professional testing!"*

**You are the Last Line of Defense.**  
Before Auntie Som launches this app to 1,000+ hungry customers, you must audit the system, find the logic flaws, and automate the validation using **Bruno**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
- 🖋️ Write **Bruno test scripts** for automated validation.
- 📦 Extract values from API responses using **Post-response scripts**.
- 🔐 Manage and use **Environment Variables**.
- 🧠 Verify **Business Rules**, not just HTTP status codes.
- 🚀 Catch regressions automatically before they hit production.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prepare the Project
- **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
- **Clone it** locally to your machine.

### 2️⃣ Start the API Server
The backend is a lightweight Flask application.
- **Requirements:** Python 3.10+ installed.
- **Navigate** to the `auntie-som-noodle-api` folder.
- **Install dependencies:**  
  ```bash
  pip install flask
  ```
- **Run the server:**  
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- The server will run at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 3️⃣ Setup Bruno
- Download and install [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com).
- Create a **New Collection** named `Auntie Som Lab`.
- Create an **Environment** (e.g., `local`) and set a variable `baseUrl` to `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🕵️ Your Mission: The Silent Auditor

Your task is to create a comprehensive Bruno collection that validates the entire workflow.  

⚠️ **The Catch:** Nephew Lek left several **logic bugs** in the system. Some endpoints might return `200 OK` even when the business logic is completely broken.

**Your collection must include:**
1.  **Auth Flow**: Automatically store the `accessToken` from login and use it for subsequent requests.
2.  **Order Validation**: Ensure orders can only be placed with valid auth, valid items, and available stock.
3.  **Data Integrity**: Check that the `totalPrice` calculated by the API matches your expectations.
4.  **Edge Cases**: What happens if you order more than what's in stock? What happens if you request a non-existent order?

> [!TIP]
> **Clicking "Send" is not testing.** Your tests must contain scripts (Assertions or Javascript) that **FAIL** when the system behaves incorrectly.

---

## 🧠 Rules of the Lab
- ❌ **Do NOT** modify the `app.py` backend code.
- ❌ **Do NOT** rely on manual checking.
- ✅ **Use environment variables** for the Base URL and Tokens.
- ✅ **Use Scripts/Assertions** for all validations.

---

## 📦 What to Submit

1.  **Push your Bruno collection folder** to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Update your README.md** (the one in your fork) with:
    - A summary of the bugs you discovered.
    - How your tests detect these bugs.
4.  **Send the GitHub link** to your instructor via Discord.

*Good luck. Auntie Som is counting on you!* 🍜🔥

## Summary what i do.

1. Try order with Unauthorized and no token in header => expected 401
2. Test Authentication Login
3. Test Get Menu
4. Test Order by order it to run out of stock and check total price => expect 201
5. Test check Order detail order id , totalPrice show that same with order
6. Test order out of stock item => expect 400
7. Test order quantity over stock itme => expect 400
8. Check Menu stock in each item

## What i found.
[ Logic Error ]
1. POST /orders => totalPrice field is wrong.
2. POST /orders => can order with quantity more than in stock
3. GET /menu => from flow stock of item didn't match with the test expect
    - This error may be come from it can order with quantity more than in stock ( From 2. )

[ Warning ]
I found the status code 200 it shoud use for GET PUT but this use status code 200 on POST ( POST shoud use status code 201 ).
